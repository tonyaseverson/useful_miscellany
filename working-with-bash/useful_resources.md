Below are a few selected resources (tutorials, documentation, books)
that I’ve found valuable for figuring out how to do things on the
command line in the bash shell.

## Books

#### O’Reilly for Higher Education

UBC Library provides access to students, staff, and faculty at UBC and it 
is a terrific resource for learning about all things related to
programming. Many of the books were originally published by O’Reilly
Media, Inc., but videos and materials from a multitude of other publishers are included.

Books available that I’ve found particularly useful include:

* [Learning the bash
    Shell](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-the-bash/0596009658/)

* [sed &
    awk](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/sed-awk/1565922255/)

* [Unix in a
    Nutshell](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/unix-in-a/0596100299/)

Other books are available on bash and pretty much every other
programming language from O’Reilly.
